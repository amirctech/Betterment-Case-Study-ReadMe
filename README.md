## The Betterment Story
Betterment as the largest independent roboadvisor was incorporated on August 25th, 2008 by Jon STein and Eli Broverman. Jon Stein realized the concepts he learned while studying behavioral economics and biology were applicable to the many errors we making in managing our investments.Despite economics pushing us off as rational humans, Stein recongizes were are very much driven by our emotions and this affects us in the financial realm. Stein was often ineffeciently monitoring money through 7 different brokerage accounts or in other words the middleman while wasting time, taxes, and transaction costs without turnign a profit much like investors that play the market. 

He then decided to create and amp people up about a service that would inevtiably manage his money by telling him what to do and then he did it but Stein had to build it himself with the help of a software engineer Sean Owen. Stein worked closely with a genius engineer, entreprenuriual lawyer, graphic designer, and product developer to step through processes ranging from setting up front and back-end to filing as an SEC-reigstered investment advisor and status as a broker-dealer (BD) to succesfully launch Betterment. 

On May 26th, 2010, Betterment bootstrapped and forgone salaries to prepare for their TechCrunch and won Biggest New York Disruptor by acuqiring 400 new customers who trusted Betterment, the roboadvisor to manage their money. Since then, Betterment has an amount of $435 million in total funding over 10 rounds from 26 investors with the latest Debt Financing round on September 29th, 2021. The success of Betterment has also allowed for 3 acuqisitions including Gradvisor, Makra, and ImpulseSave all leading to a post-money valuation in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion as of September 29th, 2021.

Betterment is a selfsustaining robo-advisor and offers low-fee investment management for new to expert investors and provides all users with wrap-around financial planning.

With an account minimum of $0 and a necessary $10 to start investing, Betterment is attractive to beginners in the market.

Dependent on the customers goals, there are expert paths into investment such as Smart Beta and socially responsible investment (SRI) portfolio choices. The robo-advisor can also invest in diversified crypto portfolios due to Betterment acquiring Makara. Nonetheless, the standard portfolio at Betterment includes ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and index funds such as Vanguard

Further, Betterment offers checking and high-yield cash reserve accounts. It doesn't stop at per usual market  investment as Betterment is also increasing access to IRAs and 401(k)’s for customers. While Betterment is automating this money management for customers through its robo-advisors, it seems to provide the essential services of banks.

What sets Betterment apart from its typical competitor? Betterment implements a goal through a series of questions to effectively manage money for its customers via The Goal Forecaster tool. The savings and investing are separated into spheres that have their own growth, timeline, and risk measurements. Customers can choose from 5 different goals:
* Retirement
* Retirement Income
* Major purchase
* Safety Net 
* General Investing

If you’re saving to buy a home, then part of your savings is put into conservative bonds and retirement? Customers can expect more aggressive investments. The Goal Forecaster tool gives you a board view of your assets and allows you to calculate when you are nearing a goal.

Betterment’s robo advisors utilizes data science and statistical modeling which is seen in the readjustments of portfolios for customers. For example, Betterment uses Monte Carlo simulations which run through thousands of market environments and creates portfolios based on the scenarios to create the best option. The robo-advisor also uses Black-Litterman model which is a portfolio-allocation framework.

A great example of the statistical aspects of Betterment is exemplified in portfolio management. If a portfolio deviates 3% above or below the set asset percentage, the robo advisor will do a balance act on the portfolio to ensure customers stay on track with their goals. Simply put, Betterment is a great option with its combination of the robo advisor, investment experts, and holistic financial services for its various customers.
