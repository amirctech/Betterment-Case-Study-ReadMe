## The Betterment Story |
Betterment as the largest independent roboadvisor was incorporated on August 25th, 2008 by Jon STein and Eli Broverman. Jon Stein realized the concepts he learned while studying behavioral economics and biology were applicable to the many errors we making in managing our investments.Despite economics pushing us off as rational humans, Stein recongizes were are very much driven by our emotions and this affects us in the financial realm. Stein was often ineffeciently monitoring money through 7 different brokerage accounts or in other words the middleman while wasting time, taxes, and transaction costs without turnign a profit much like investors that play the market. 

He then decided to create and amp people up about a service that would inevtiably manage his money by telling him what to do and then he did it but Stein had to build it himself with the help of a software engineer Sean Owen. Stein worked closely with a genius engineer, entreprenuriual lawyer, graphic designer, and product developer to step through processes ranging from setting up front and back-end to filing as an SEC-reigstered investment advisor and status as a broker-dealer (BD) to succesfully launch Betterment. 

On May 26th, 2010, Betterment bootstrapped and forgone salaries to prepare for their TechCrunch and won Biggest New York Disruptor by acuqiring 400 new customers who trusted Betterment, the roboadvisor to manage their money. Since then, Betterment has an amount of $435 million in total funding over 10 rounds from 26 investors with the latest Debt Financing round on September 29th, 2021. The success of Betterment has also allowed for 3 acuqisitions including Gradvisor, Makra, and ImpulseSave all leading to a post-money valuation in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion as of September 29th, 2021.

## Betterment's Business Activties |

Financial investment can be difficult for beginners, and Betterment steps into solve this issue via a unique robo-advisor. As a heads up, robo-advisors are accessible financial experts that learn more about your goals and automate money management at a low cost to its customers. This is the starting point for Jon Stein creating  Betterment.

Betterment is a selfsustaining robo-advisor and offers low-fee investment management for new to expert investors and provides all users with wrap-around financial planning. Much like other robo-advisors, Betterment's intended customers are beginners that not only want to automate our money management but also receive financial education to improve their skills in investment. With an account minimum of $0 and a necessary $10 to start investing, Betterment is attractive to beginners in the market.

Dependent on the customers goals, there are expert paths into investment such as Smart Beta and socially responsible investment (SRI) portfolio choices. The robo-advisor can also invest in diversified crypto portfolios due to Betterment acquiring Makara. Nonetheless, the standard portfolio at Betterment includes ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and index funds such as Vanguard

Further, Betterment offers checking and high-yield cash reserve accounts. It doesn't stop at per usual market  investment as Betterment is also increasing access to IRAs and 401(k)’s for customers. While Betterment is automating this money management for customers through its robo-advisors, it seems to provide the essential services of banks.

What sets Betterment apart from its typical competitor? Betterment implements a goal through a series of questions to effectively manage money for its customers via The Goal Forecaster tool. The savings and investing are separated into spheres that have their own growth, timeline, and risk measurements. Customers can choose from 5 different goals:
* Retirement
* Retirement Income
* Major purchase
* Safety Net 
* General Investing

If you’re saving to buy a home, then part of your savings is put into conservative bonds and retirement? Customers can expect more aggressive investments. The Goal Forecaster tool gives you a board view of your assets and allows you to calculate when you are nearing a goal.

Betterment’s robo advisors utilizes data science and statistical modeling which is seen in the readjustments of portfolios for customers. For example, Betterment uses Monte Carlo simulations which run through thousands of market environments and creates portfolios based on the scenarios to create the best option. The robo-advisor also uses Black-Litterman model which is a portfolio-allocation framework.

A great example of the statistical aspects of Betterment is exemplified in portfolio management. If a portfolio deviates 3% above or below the set asset percentage, the robo advisor will do a balance act on the portfolio to ensure customers stay on track with their goals. Simply put, Betterment is a great option with its combination of the robo advisor, investment experts, and holistic financial services for its various customers. 

## Landscape of Roboadvisors |

Betterment is in the domain of roboadvisors within the fintech industry. 

Let’s keep it simple. A roboadvisor is a mobile app that uses different technological approaches to provide and automate financial and investment planning for its customers. The robot advisor might provide a survey to get a deeper understanding of your current finances and longer term goals. Much like Betterment, the roboadvisor uses its processes and sifts through data to create a portfolio for customers.

The technology seen in roboadvisors might inevitably replace wealth managers due to it being an affordable, accessible, and digital platform to invest money. Much of the technology used by robodaviors stems from the software wealth managers used to automate portfolio allocation at the start of the 2000s.

As stated previously, there are robotadivsors that implement statistical modeling, algorithms  indexing strategies which are relevant to modern portfolio theory (PMT). Such mechanisms allow for rebalancing which returns portfolios to a specific target if it surpases a particular bandwidth. Robot advisors also utilize tax loss harvesting or in other words selling securities at a loss to skirt the capital gains tax liability which is cost friendly to its customers.

What new technology are prevalent to roboadvisors? There is debate on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) versus statistical modeling when accessing big data to generate investment portfolios. In terms of AI, Betterment tested neural networks which trains the bot to analyze a set of data but it underperforms when it comes to predictions in the real world. 

Although Betterment does not use such machine learning on the front end, companies often use AI to calculate profitability and volatility of different investment tools like ETFs. With roboadivsors stepping into cryptocurrency machine learning for clustering methods to create portfolios is also a big deal.

But who are roboadivsors? The top 5 roboadvisors is Acorns at 9%, Betterment at 8% and Charles Schwab at 6%, M1 at 6%, and SoFi at 5% of total market share throughout the industry. 
Acorns is platform that takes small savings based on spending habits and micro-investments to save for goals such as retirement. On the other hand, Schwabs Intelligent Portfolios is in the similar business of rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and no management fees for its customers. M1 takes hybrid approach as it functions as as roboadvisor and broker  which allows customers to build a portfolio as the bot automates the investment. 

There is a lot of competition as  each roboadvisor utilizes different technology in the realms of big data to create successful portfolios and disrupt the fintech industry. Yet, we can expect Betterment to set trends and  evolve into the top roboadvisor as it turns money for its customers.
