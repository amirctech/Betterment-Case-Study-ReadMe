## The Betterment Story
Betterment as the largest independent roboadvisor was incorporated on August 25th, 2008 by Jon STein and Eli Broverman. Jon Stein realized the concepts he learned while studying behavioral economics and biology were applicable to the many errors we making in managing our investments.Despite economics pushing us off as rational humans, Stein recongizes were are very much driven by our emotions and this affects us in the financial realm. Stein was often ineffeciently monitoring money through 7 different brokerage accounts or in other words the middleman while wasting time, taxes, and transaction costs without turnign a profit much like investors that play the market. 

He then decided to create and amp people up about a service that would inevtiably manage his money by telling him what to do and then he did it but Stein had to build it himself with the help of a software engineer Sean Owen. Stein worked closely with a genius engineer, entreprenuriual lawyer, graphic designer, and product developer to step through processes ranging from setting up front and back-end to filing as an SEC-reigstered investment advisor and status as a broker-dealer (BD) to succesfully launch Betterment. 

On May 26th, 2010, Betterment bootstrapped and forgone salaries to prepare for their TechCrunch and won Biggest New York Disruptor by acuqiring 400 new customers who trusted Betterment, the roboadvisor to manage their money. Since then, Betterment has an amount of $435 million in total funding over 10 rounds from 26 investors with the latest Debt Financing round on September 29th, 2021. The success of Betterment has also allowed for 3 acuqisitions including Gradvisor, Makra, and ImpulseSave all leading to a post-money valuation in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion as of September 29th, 2021.
